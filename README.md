# Atmosphere 2
Atmosphere 2 (A2) is a project to design a control system that can emulate climate scenarios in the artificial ecosystems comprising the Sonoran research facility Biosphere 2 (B2). To enable optimal ecological experimentation, the primary goal is to build an automated program that gives researchers accurate and precise control that is robust against changes in the ambient weather.

A secondary goal is to design an energy-efficient default that will still emulate the desired climate but in a relaxed away, allowing cold days to be colder and warm days to be warmer but remaining in accordance with the natural variability of the ecosystem.

## Building Twins
This folder contains a hierarchy of digitial twins for a green house building. The scripts used to generate models and the models themselves are included.
